Leafy Dialogue is a simple multiple-choice dialogue tool designed for the Unity3D game engine. Please note that this tool was created exclusively for a school project and is unlikely to receive any further updates. However, I am currently working on a more advanced and robust system that will be released soon. In the meantime, you are welcome to use this tool.

The installation instructions for the tool can be found in the wiki.

Here are some of the features of Leafy Dialogue:

- Broadcasting messages
- Triggering animations
- Triggering audio
- Multiple-choice options

To subscribe to a message, simply call Messenger.AddListener("Your message here", your function here). This tool uses an updated version of the Unity Messenger class from the old Unity Wiki.
