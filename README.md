# Leafy Dialogue
A basic multiple-choice dialogue system for the Unity3D game engine.

This tool is very unlikely to get updated as I just made it for a school project. I am currently working on a more robust and advanced 
system that will come out eventually. Until then, enjoy this.

# List of Features
- Broadcasting messages
- Triggering animations
- Triggering Audio
- Multiple Choice

To subscribe to a message, call Messenger.AddListener("Your message here", your function here). It uses an updated version of the Unity Messenger class from the old Unity Wiki.
